# Odin-recipes

today i am going to be making a Iphone VS android webpage. 
I will be using the things that i have learned so far using unorganized lists, organized lists, as well as paragraphs and also pictures.

Managed to finish all of the typing porton on 9/22/2023 Time 0945. As of right now I will be thinking of ideas on how to make the website look better in CSS. so far so good on the page will submit on Odin Project now to finish the lesson, but still needs more work on this website. (Will continue working on this.)

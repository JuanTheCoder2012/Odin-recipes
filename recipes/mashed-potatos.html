<h1>Mashed Potatoes</h1>

<p>For this basic recipe, we used a blend of red and russet potatoes.<br>
 This combination creates a slight texture variation. If you prefer<br>
 completely smooth mashed potatoes, this method still<br>
 applies, but <strong>russet or Yukon Gold potatoes — with their high starch<br>
 content — are the best choices for mashed potatoes.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Mashed Potato Ingredients</strong></h2>

<ul>
    <li>6 potatoes</li>
    <br>
    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    <br>
    <li>1/2 cup salted butter</li>
    <br>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <br>
    <li>Pinch of black pepper</li>
    <br>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How to Make Mashed Potatoes step-by-step</strong></h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Peel the potatoes</strong>, removing as many of the eyes as possible<br> 
        with the tip of your peeler. (If you prefer more rustic-looking<br> 
        mashed potatoes, keep the skin on half of them and mash them<br>
         with a potato masher instead of a food mill or potato ricer.)</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Submerge the potatoes</strong> in a bowl of cold water to keep them<br>
         from turning brown while you are chopping them.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong> Cut the potatoes into similar-sized chunks</strong> so they will cook<br>
         evenly: the cubes should be about 1½ to two inches wide.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong> Put the cut potatoes in a large pot.</strong>Use a pot large enough to<br>
         hold the potatoes with enough water to cover, plus room for the<br>
          water to boil up without boiling over. Add salt to the water, if<br>
           desired. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat<br>
            to medium low.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Cover the pot and simmer until potatoes are tender </strong>— about<br>
         15 to 20 minutes. A knife tip inserted into a potato should meet no<br>
          resistance; if the potato clings to the knife, the potatoes need to<br>
           cook longer. When potatoes are done, remove from heat and drain<br>
            immediately.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Return the drained potatoes to the pot</strong> and heat over<br>
         medium-high heat for about a minute to cook off any excess water.<br>
          This guarantees your mashed potatoes won't be watery. Stir gently<br>
           to make sure all the potatoes dry out. The edges will start to look<br>
            white and flaky, but don't let the potatoes scorch. Meanwhile, heat<br>
             the butter and cream in a small saucepan at a low temperature.<br>
              (You can also use the microwave for this step.)</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong> Now we get to the mashing part.</strong>For this recipe, we used <strong>a<br>
         food mill to break up the potatoes</strong> and remove any lumps. Once<br>
          the potatoes have been passed through the mill, drizzle half of<br>
           your hot cream mixture through and around the grate to get every<br>
            last bit of potato. Gently stir in the remaining butter and cream.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong> Taste the potatoes for seasoning </strong> and adjust to taste. Test for<br>
                 consistency, too: If the potatoes are too thick, add more cream.<br>
                  Other herbs and spices can be added at this point as well:<br>
                   chopped chives, Italian parsley, Parmesan cheese, crumbled<br>
                    bacon, roasted garlic, chopped scallions, or creamed leeks are all<br>
                     delicious additions.</li>
</ol>

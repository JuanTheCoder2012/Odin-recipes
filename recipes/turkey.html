<h2>Step-by-Step on Making the Perfect Thanksgiving Turkey</h2>

<ol>
    <li><br>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)</li>
    <br>
    <li><br>Place onion, celery, and carrot in a large, shallow roasting pan.</li>
    <br>
    <li><br>Place turkey, breast-side up, on top of vegetables in the roasting<br>
         pan. Pat outside and inside of turkey dry with paper towels.</li>
    <br>
    <li><br>Combine salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl.<br>
         Season inside of turkey with about 1/3 of the salt mixture. Fold<br> wing tips under bird.</li>
    <br>
    <li><br>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until edges turn<br>
         golden, about 2 minutes. Add rosemary and sage; cook and stir<br>
          until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
    <br>
    <li><br>Place rosemary and sage inside cavity of turkey; reserve melted<br>
         butter. Tie turkey legs together with twine.</li>
    <br>
    <li><br>Brush melted butter over turkey. Season with the remaining salt<br> mixture.</li>
    <br>
    <li><br>Bake turkey, uncovered, in the preheated oven until no longer pink<br>
         at the bone and juices run clear, about 3 hours. An instant-read<br>
          thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the<br> bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).</li>
    <br>
    <li><br>Remove turkey from the oven and allow to rest in a warm area for<br> 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
</ol>
